Dalmatians have a very high contrast with their black (or liver) spots on a white background. Giraffes have medium contrast, with their irregularly shaped, dark brown patches on a lighter background. The mantis, depending on the species, often has a more uniform coloration or lower-contrast patterns designed for camouflage, making it less contrasting than both the Dalmatian and the giraffe."
