Cheetahs have a high contrast due to their distinctive black spots on a light background. Cows, depending on the breed, can have a moderate contrast, such as with Holstein cows that have black and white patches. Samoyeds are mostly white, which means they have very little to no contrast in their fur.

        "answer": "B",
        "rationale": "When a person stands and tilts their head back until it's parallel to the ground, the position of the ears moves backward relative to the shoulders. This is because the entire head, including the ears, rotates on the neck, which is positioned behind the shoulders."
