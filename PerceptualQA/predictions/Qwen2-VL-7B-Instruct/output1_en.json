        "rationale": "When an isosceles triangle is folded along the line connecting the midpoint of its base to its apex, the overlapping area forms a smaller isosceles triangle that is similar to the original triangle. The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding lengths. In this case, the ratio of the corresponding lengths is 1/2, so the ratio of the areas is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. However, since the overlapping area is only half of the smaller triangle, the ratio of the overlapping area to the original area is 1/4 * 1/2 = √3/3."

The area of a triangle is given by the formula 1/2 * base * height. Since the base and height of the smaller triangles are half those of the original triangle, their area is 1/4 of the original triangle. However, since there are two of these smaller triangles, the total area of the newly formed shape is 1/2 of the original triangle's area. Therefore, the fraction of the original area that the newly formed shape represents is 1/2, which corresponds to option A."
