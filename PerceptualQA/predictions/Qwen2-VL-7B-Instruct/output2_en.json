The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding lengths. In this case, the ratio of the corresponding lengths is 1/2, so the ratio of the areas is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. However, since the overlapping area is only half of the smaller triangle, the ratio of the overlapping area to the original area is 1/4 * 1/2 = √2/2."
