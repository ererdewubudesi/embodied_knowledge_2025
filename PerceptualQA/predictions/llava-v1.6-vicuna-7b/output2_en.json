When cooked, the saturated fat in lamb can increase the overall saturation of the dish. In contrast, crab is a shellfish that is low in saturated fat, so it has a lower saturation when cooked. Shrimp is also a low-fat protein option, but it is not as low in saturated fat as crab. Abalone is a seafood that is low in fat and saturated fat, so it has the least decrease in saturation when cooked."

        "answer": "C",
        "rationale": "The answer is not necessarily true, as the distance between the knee and ankle can increase or decrease depending on various factors such as muscle strength, flexibility, and joint mobility."
    },
    {
        "index": 5182,
        "answer": "C",
        "rationale": "The distance between the ankle and the hip joint typically decreases during the cushioning process of the lower limbs, as the foot flattens and the leg extends to absorb shock during walking or running."

        "answer": "B",
        "rationale": "At the moment of takeoff, a diver's foot typically makes contact with the diving board with the toes, as this is the natural position for the foot during the takeoff motion."

        "index": 5184,
        "answer": "B",
        "rationale": "When standing on tiptoes, the distance from the heel to the ground is generally smaller than the distance from the toes to the ground, as the heel is lifted off the ground while the toes remain in contact with the ground."

        "index": 5185,
        "answer": "B",
        "rationale": "The distance from the heel to the ground is the same as the distance from the center of the sole to the ground when standing on tiptoes."

        "answer": "B",
        "rationale": "When standing on tiptoes, the distance from the center of the foot sole to the ground is greater than the distance from the toes to the ground, as the foot is lifted off the ground and the sole is stretched."

        "index": 5188,
        "answer": "C",
        "rationale": "When extending the lower limbs, the distance between the knees and buttocks typically increases. This is because the knees and hips move away from each other as the legs are extended, resulting in a longer distance between the two points."

    {
        "index": 5189,
        "answer": "A",
        "rationale": "When a person jumps, the tip of the foot is usually higher than the heel at the moment of jump. This is because the foot is pointing downward towards the ground during the initial phase of the jump, and then it swings upward towards the air during the propulsive phase. As a result, the tip of the foot is higher than the heel at the peak of the jump."

        "answer": "C",
        "rationale": "When jumping off on one foot, the toe of the jumping foot is usually higher than the heel. This is because the foot is lifted off the ground and the toes are pointing upwards, causing the toe to be higher than the heel."

        "index": 5191,
        "answer": "C",
        "rationale": "During the whipping motion of the lower limb, the distance between the ankle and knee initially decreases as the foot is brought back behind the body, then increases as the foot is brought forward in front of the body during the swing phase of the gait cycle."

        "index": 5192,
        "answer": "B",

        "answer": "B",
        "rationale": "When a person stands and rotates their upper body to the right, the left shoulder moves forward relative to the right shoulder. Therefore, the left shoulder is more forward in this scenario."

        "index": 5195,
        "answer": "D",
        "rationale": "When a person stands and rotates their upper body to the left, their left shoulder will be further back. This is because the shoulder joint is a ball-and-socket joint that allows for a wide range of motion, including rotation. As the person rotates their upper body to the left, their left shoulder will move back relative to their right shoulder."
