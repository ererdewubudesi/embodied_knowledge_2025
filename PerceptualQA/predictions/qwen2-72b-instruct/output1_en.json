        "rationale": "During the cushioning process of the lower limbs, the knee typically moves closer to the hip joint, increasing the distance as the leg bends to absorb impact."

        "index": 5181,
        "answer": "B",
        "rationale": "When the lower limbs are buffering, as in absorbing impact or adjusting to maintain balance, the joints including the knee and ankle work together to distribute force. This action does not necessarily increase or decrease the distance between the knee and ankle but rather involves the flexion and extension of these joints to maintain stability, meaning the distance remains essentially unchanged."
