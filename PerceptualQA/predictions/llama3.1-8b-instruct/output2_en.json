However, since the smaller triangle is formed by folding the original triangle in half, the ratio of the overlapping area to the original area is 1/2. But, this is a simplification. The correct answer can be derived by considering the properties of 30-60-90 triangles. When the equilateral triangle is folded along its angle bisector, it creates two 30-60-90 triangles. The ratio of the area of the overlapping region to the original area is then the ratio of the area of one of the 30-60-90 triangles to the area of the equilateral triangle. This can be calculated using the properties of 30-60-90 triangles, and is found to be √3/3."
