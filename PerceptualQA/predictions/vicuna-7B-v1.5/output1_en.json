    {
        "index": 5190,
        "answer": "B",
        "rationale": "When jumping off on one foot, the toe of the jumping foot is usually higher than the heel. This is because the foot is extended and the toes are pointing upward during the jump. The heel is lower and behind the toes, providing a stable base for the jump."

        "index": 5191,
        "answer": "B",
        "rationale": "The distance between the ankle and knee changes during the whipping motion of the lower limb. It decreases initially, then increases again. This motion is necessary for propulsion and is characteristic of running and jumping movements."
    },
    {
        "index": 5192,
        "answer": "C",
        "rationale": "The distance between the knee and the hip changes during the lower limb whipping motion. In the initial phase, the distance decreases as the knee flexes, and then it increases again as the hip extends. Option A is incorrect because the distance does not remain unchanged. Option B is incorrect because the distance does change, and Option D is incorrect because the change is not first decreases and then increases."

        "index": 5195,
        "answer": "B",
        "rationale": "The answer depends on the specific rotation of the upper body and the position of the shoulders. Without additional information, it is not possible to determine which shoulder is further back."

    {
        "index": 5196,
        "answer": "D",
        "rationale": "When a person stands and rotates their upper body to the right, the left shoulder will be further back. This is because the body's natural tendency is to rotate towards the opposite side of the movement, which in this case is the right side. Therefore, the left shoulder will move further back than the right shoulder during this rotation."

        "answer": "B",
        "rationale": "The position of the shoulders when a person is seated depends on various factors such as the angle of the turn, the height of the person, and the seating position. It is not possible to determine the position of the shoulders without additional information."
