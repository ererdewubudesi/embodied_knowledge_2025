When reducing the saturation of a color, its brightness may or may not change depending on the original value of the color. In the case of aloe green, which is a light green color, reducing its saturation may result in a darker shade of green, but it may also result in a lighter shade of green if the original value was already low. Therefore, the answer is 'Not necessarily'."
