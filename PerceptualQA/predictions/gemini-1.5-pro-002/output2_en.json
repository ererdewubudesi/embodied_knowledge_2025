        "answer": "B",
        "rationale": "The distance between the knee and ankle is determined by the length of the bones in the lower leg (tibia and fibula).  These bones don't change length when the leg extends or flexes."

    {
        "index": 5188,
        "answer": "A",
        "rationale": "When extending the lower limbs, you are straightening your legs. This action decreases the angle between your thighs and calves, thus decreasing the distance between the knees and buttocks."
    },
    {
        "index": 5189,
        "answer": "A",
        "rationale": "When jumping, the action of pushing off the ground typically starts with the toes, making the tip of the foot higher than the heel at the moment of jump."

    {
        "index": 5190,
        "answer": "C",
        "rationale": "When jumping off one foot, you push off your toes, making them the last part of your foot to leave the ground. This means the toe would be higher than the heel."

    {
        "index": 5191,
        "answer": "B",
        "rationale": "During the whipping motion of the lower limb, the knee extends while the ankle also extends. This simultaneous extension results in the ankle and knee getting closer together, thus decreasing the distance between them."
    },
    {
        "index": 5192,
        "answer": "B",
        "rationale": "At the start of a whipping motion, the knee is brought closer to the hip, decreasing the distance. As the leg extends for the whip, the distance between the knee and hip then increases."
    },
    {
        "index": 5193,
        "answer": "A",
        "rationale": "When you rotate your upper body to the left, your right shoulder naturally moves forward while your left shoulder moves back."
    },
    {
        "index": 5194,
        "answer": "B",
        "rationale": "When someone rotates their upper body to the right, their left shoulder will be more forward. Imagine yourself doing the motion - it's a twisting movement."
    },
    {
        "index": 5195,
        "answer": "A",
        "rationale": "When rotating the upper body to the left, the right shoulder will naturally move backward relative to the left shoulder."

        "rationale": "When you rotate your upper body to the right, your left shoulder will naturally move further back than your right shoulder."

        "index": 5197,
        "answer": "C",
        "rationale": "When turning to the right in a seated position, the right shoulder naturally rotates forward due to the mechanics of the body's rotation."

        "index": 5198,
        "answer": "A",
        "rationale": "When turning to the left in a seated position, the right shoulder naturally rotates forward due to the mechanics of the torso."

    {
        "index": 5199,
        "answer": "C",
        "rationale": "When you turn to the right while seated, your left shoulder naturally rotates backwards, placing it further back than the right shoulder."

        "index": 5200,
        "answer": "D",
        "rationale": "When a person turns to their left while seated, their right shoulder will naturally rotate further back. Imagine the motion: turning left twists the torso, moving the right shoulder backward relative to the left."
