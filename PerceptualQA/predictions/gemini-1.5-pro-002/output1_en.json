The question likely refers to how many capital letters *after* E in the alphabet have horizontal lines.  F has one. G has one. H has one. I has none.  If we consider upper case letters F, G and H, F has 1, G has 1 and H has 1 horizontal lines. So, If the question meant how many different letters have horizontal lines, the answer would be 3.  However, If it is referring to total horizontal lines in each letter, the answer would be 1+1+1 = 3. If E is shifted and we count the total number of horizontal lines in the new letter, it would depend on how many places it was shifted. If E was shifted one place, it becomes F and it contains 1 horizontal line. If E was shifted two places, it becomes G and it contains 1 horizontal line. If E was shifted three places, it becomes H and it contains 1 horizontal line. However, since shifting to the right is ambiguous in the scope of letters, we can also consider shifting E to the immediate letters to its right. F has one horizontal line, G has one, and H has one. That gives a total of 3 horizontal lines. But if the question asks about the distinct horizontal lines across these three letters, F's top line and G's middle line can be seen as extensions and together they can form a long horizontal line. And since H has a middle line as well, it can be said there are two distinct horizontal lines. So the answer is 2."
