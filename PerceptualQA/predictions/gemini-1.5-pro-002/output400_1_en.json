        "rationale": "Walking on a marble floor produces a higher-pitched sound than walking on a sandy beach.  This is because the hard surface of the marble reflects the sound waves more efficiently, leading to higher frequencies and thus a higher pitch. Sand, being a loose and absorbent material, dampens the sound and absorbs many of the higher frequencies, resulting in a lower-pitched sound."
