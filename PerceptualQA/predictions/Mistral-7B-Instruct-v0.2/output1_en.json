In the original triangle, these segments are of equal length, so the area is (base x height), and in the newly formed triangle, each base is half the length of the original base, and the height is also half, resulting in an area of (1/2 x 1/2) = 1/4 of the original area.

        "index": 5183,
        "answer": "B",
        "rationale": "The moment of takeoff for a diver involves dynamic forces and movements that make it difficult to determine precisely how the foot contacts the diving board. Additionally, without specific information about the type of diving board or the diver's technique, it's not possible to definitively answer this question."

        "index": 5184,
        "answer": "B",
        "rationale": "When standing on tiptoes, the distance from the heel to the ground is shorter than the distance from the toes to the ground because the person is stretching their legs to reach a greater height."
    },
    {
        "index": 5185,
        "answer": "C",
        "rationale": "When standing on tiptoes, the distance from the heel to the ground is smaller than the distance from the center of the sole to the ground because the person is leaning forward slightly."

        "index": 5186,
        "answer": "C",
        "rationale": "When standing on tiptoes, the distance from the center of the foot sole to the ground is greater than the distance from the toes to the ground because the toes are raised higher off the ground."

        "index": 5187,
        "answer": "B",
        "rationale": "When extending the lower limbs, the distance between the knee and ankle decreases. This is because the extension of the lower limbs results in a more upright posture, reducing the apparent distance between the knee and ankle."
    },
    {
        "index": 5188,
        "answer": "B",
        "rationale": "As the lower limbs are extended, the distance between the knees and buttocks generally increases due to the lengthening of the legs. This is a fundamental principle in biomechanics and human motion."
    },
    {
        "index": 5189,
        "answer": "B",
        "rationale": "At the moment of jump, the tip of the foot is usually lower than the heel. This is because the foot is stretched out and the toes are pointing down, which lowers the tip of the foot relative to the heel."
    },
    {
        "index": 5190,
        "answer": "B",
        "rationale": "When jumping off on one foot, the toe of the jumping foot is usually higher than the heel due to the body's momentum and the positioning of the foot during the jump."

    {
        "index": 5191,
        "answer": "C",
        "rationale": "The distance between the ankle and knee typically decreases during the whipping motion of the lower limb."

        "index": 5192,
        "answer": "C",
        "rationale": "During the lower limb whipping motion, the distance between the knee and the hip increases as the leg swings forward."

        "index": 5193,
        "answer": "D",
        "rationale": "When a person rotates their upper body to the left, the left shoulder will be more forward due to the motion of the arm."

    {
        "index": 5194,
        "answer": "D",
        "rationale": "When a person rotates their upper body to the right, the left shoulder will be more forward due to the body's natural posture and muscle strength."
    },
    {
        "index": 5195,
        "answer": "D",
        "rationale": "When a person rotates their upper body to the left, the right shoulder will be further back due to the body's natural alignment and muscle structure."
