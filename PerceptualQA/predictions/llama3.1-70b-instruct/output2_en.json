However, considering the nature of the rotation and the resulting angle, the correct positional relationship is actually 'Perpendicular' because the original line and the rotated line form a right angle (90°) at the point of rotation, but since the rotation is 45°, it's actually a 45° angle and the lines are not perpendicular.

However, if we consider the line segment as the diagonal of a square (which is not explicitly stated in the question but is a common interpretation), the relationship between the diagonal and the side length of a square is given by the Pythagorean theorem, where the diagonal is √2 times the side length. Therefore, each side's length would be 1/√2 or √2/2 of the original line segment, but this is not among the options. Considering the line segment as the perimeter of three sides of the square (which is a more direct interpretation of the question), each side's length would be 1/3 of the original line segment's length is incorrect. However, if we consider the line segment as the perimeter of three sides of the square and the square has four equal sides, the relationship between the original line segment and each side would be that the original line segment is 3/4 of the square's perimeter.
