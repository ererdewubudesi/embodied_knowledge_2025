However, the question asks for a comparison when the person is standing on level ground, implying a neutral facial expression initially. In a neutral expression, the corners of the mouth are generally lower than the wings of the nose. When crying, the downward movement of the mouth corners is more pronounced than the downward movement of the nose wings. Therefore, the corners of the mouth are lower than the wings of the nose initially, but the question asks which is higher, so the correct answer is the corners of the mouth."
